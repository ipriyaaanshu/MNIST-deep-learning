# MNIST-deep-learning
This is a beginners' project in deep learning. I used Keras with Tensorflow as backend to create a Convolutional Neural Network for recognizing handwritten digits.


## My system Configurations

8th Gen Core i7
8 GB RAM
4GB NVIDIA 1050TI GPU


## The trained model is 99.33% Accurate in 15 Epochs
